# Welcome to the Pension Office UI Components Library!

This library is built using the popular CSS framework, TailwindCSS, and the JavaScript framework, Vue.js, to provide a set of beautiful and functional UI components for your Nuxt.js project.

The aim of this library is to provide an easy and efficient way for developers to add stylish, responsive and user-friendly components to their projects, without having to write CSS or JavaScript code from scratch.

The library includes a wide range of components, from basic UI elements like buttons, inputs, and labels, to more complex components like modals, tabs, and carousels. All of these components have been built using TailwindCSS's utility-first approach, which means they are customizable and scalable, making it easy to match your project's specific design requirements.

We believe that the Pension Office UI Components Library will greatly enhance your development experience, save you time and make it easier to create high-quality user interfaces.
