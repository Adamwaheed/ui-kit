#### clickable

The timeline component emmits the object when an item is clicked. You can use `clickable=true` property to highlight that it's clickable. And use `@button-click` event to handle the click.

You can use `button-click` without `clickable` set to true. But it is recommended to be used together, so that the user will know clicking the item has an action attached to it.

<Canvas withToolbar>
	<Story inline={true} id="content-timeline--many-clickable" />
</Canvas>

<Source
	language="js"
	dark
	format={true}
	code={dedent`
    <PoTimeline
      :timeline="locationHistory"
      :clickable="true"
      @button-click="handleTimelineClick"
    />
    const locationHistory = [
      {
        label: "Main Office",
        date: "Jan 10, 2020",
        description: "Started working at Main Office, Male City, Kaafu",
      },
    ];
    function handleTimelineClick(item) {
      console.log("handleTimelineClick", item);
    }
  `}
/>
