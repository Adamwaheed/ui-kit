# Month Year Picker component

import { Story, ArgTypes, Source, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";

import * as PoUploadStories from "./PoUpload.stories";

import dedent from "ts-dedent";

You should pass the auth token to `token`.. this is your `useCookie("auth_token")`.

`url` is the full url for the upload API endpoint including https `${useRuntimeConfig().public.api}/${url}`.

When upload is complete the `@uploaded` event returns the raw response from API so you can do response.json();.

<Story of={PoUploadStories.Upload} />

<Source
	language="js"
	dark
	format={true}
	code={dedent`
    <PoUpload
        label="Choose Document"
        token="token"
        url="https://full-api-url"
        @uploaded="handleUploadComplete"
      />
  `}
/>
