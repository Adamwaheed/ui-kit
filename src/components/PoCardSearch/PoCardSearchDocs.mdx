# Card Search component

import { Story, ArgTypes, Source, Meta } from "@storybook/blocks";

import * as PoCardSearchStories from "./PoCardSearch.stories";

import dedent from "ts-dedent";

<Meta of={PoCardSearchStories} />

When you need to use searchbox inside the Card component, you can use CardSearch component. To get the input value from the component, you can use `v-model`.

When using this component, make sure that it is the first child of the PoCard component, meaning, it should be the first thing inside `<template v-slot:content>` in `<PoCard>`. The Card component should not have `title`, `is-loding`, or padding. You should instead use a container element inside the Card component as a sibling to PoCardSearch, which has padding. Make sure to add a padding between PoCardSearch and its next sibling.

<div className="po-p-5 po-bg-slate-100">
	<Story of={PoCardSearchStories.CardSearch} />
</div>

<Source
	language="js"
	dark
	format={true}
	code={dedent`
    <PoCard class="mt-5">
        <template v-slot:content>
            <PoCardSearch placeholder="Search card.." v-model="searchQuery" />
            ...
        </template>
    </PoCard>
  `}
/>
